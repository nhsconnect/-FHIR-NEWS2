The NEWS2 pulse rate observation uses the <a href="https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-HeartRate-Observation-1">CareConnect-HeartRate-Observation-1</a> profile.

# Guidance for Populating a NEWS2 Pulse Rate Observation #

### Note on heart rate versus pulse rate ###
This specification uses the CareConnect-HeartRate-Observation-1 to carry the NEWS2 Pulse Rate observation. It has been noted that heart rate and pulse rate are different measures, and not necessarily be interchangeable.
<br/><br/>
_‘heart rate is typically measured electrically and pulse rate physically. If you have two heart beats close together – for example ectopic beats – you can’t physically discriminate. So the pulse rate would be lower than the heart rate. It is also common in atrial fibrillation – the true heart rate can be much higher than the pulse rate.’_
<br/><br/>
The curation team had to take this into account to create an option of sending an additional specific SNOMED CT code of "78564009 | Pulse rate" in the profile for the NEWS2 use case which will be marked as userSelected value="tue" in FHIR.  This allows the sender to specify that a pulse rate was taken which is refinement of the SNOMED CT concept heart rate. The sender could just send heart rate without the pulse rate if heart rate was recorded. In the scenario, when the pulse rate is different from heart rate, it is expected only heart rate will be sent as this is more accurate from clinical perspective. A fuller account of guidance on heart rate versus pulse rate can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ByZ57nh6ZDjUEfBfPJjLAfSil_svpjBpzbarv7VB5QM/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>

When an Observation element has guidance "Not needed for NEWS2", this means that systems MAY populate the element (if appropriate) in the NEWS2 Observation.
