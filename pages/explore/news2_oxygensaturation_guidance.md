The NEWS2 oxygen saturation observation reading uses the <a href="https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-OxygenSaturation-Observation-1">CareConnect-OxygenSaturation-Observation-1</a> profile.

# Guidance for Populating a NEWS2 Oxygen Saturation Observation #

When an Observation element has guidance "Not needed for NEWS2", this means that systems MAY populate the element (if appropriate) in the NEWS2 Observation.
