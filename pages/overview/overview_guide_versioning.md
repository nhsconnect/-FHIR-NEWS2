# Alpha #
This implementation guidance is the Aphla release to support the development of NEWS2.

# Semantic Versioning #
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen (refer to [Semantic Versioning - Item 9] (http://semver.org/#spec-item-9))

# Pre-release Labels #
These labels will be taken from the GDS development process stages, and will be one of:

**Experimental**: Early development/POC version of an product for early sight during discovery

**Alpha**: Initial test product, likely to change substantially, or be discontinued as the project develops

**Beta**: APIs that are still under active development and subject to change, but that are likely to progress into a live product

**Release Candidate**: Products that are largely complete, unlikely to change substantially, but still need further testing before becoming live

**Live**: Release live Products

**Discontinued:** APIs which have been discontinued and should not be used for new development.
